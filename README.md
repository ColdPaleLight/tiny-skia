`tiny-skia` is a tiny [Skia] subset mostly ported to Rust.

The goal is to provide an absolute minimal, CPU only, 2D rendering library for the Rust ecosystem,
with a focus on a rendering quality, speed and binary size.

**Note:** this is not a Skia replacement and never will be. It's more of a research project.

## Motivation

The main motivation behind this library is to have a small, high-quality 2D rendering
library that can be used by [resvg]. And the choice is rather limited.
You basically have to choose between cairo, Qt and Skia. And all of them are
relatively bloated, hard to compile and distribute. Not to mention that none of them
is written in Rust.

But if we ignore those problems and focus only on quality and speed alone,
Skia is by far the best one.
However, the main problem with Skia is that it's huge. Really huge.
It supports CPU and GPU rendering, multiple input and output formats (including SVG and PDF),
various filters, color spaces, color types and text rendering.
It consists of 370 KLOC without dependencies (around 7 MLOC with dependencies)
and requires around 4-8 GiB of disk space to be built from sources.
And the final binary is 3-8 MiB big, depending on enabled features.
Not to mention that it requires `clang` and no other compiler,
uses an obscure build system (`gn`) which still uses Python2
and doesn't really support 32bit targets.

`tiny-skia` tries to be small, simple and easy to build.

## Build

Sadly, `tiny-skia` still relies on C++ code, therefore you will need a C++ compiler.
But not just any compiler. You **must** use `clang` (or `clang-cl` on Windows).
Skia doesn't support any other compilers, so all optimizations will simply be disabled.

You don't need to select the `clang` compiler manually.
The build script will do this automatically (as long as you have it in the PATH).

The are no other build dependencies.

**Warning:** 32bit targets are not supported.

## Performance

Unless there is a bug, the performance must be identical to Skia.
Mainly because we are using Skia's `SkRasterPipeline` fork instead of Rust alternative.

Can we port `SkRasterPipeline` to Rust? Probably not.
Rust doesn't support clang's vector extensions and ARM NEON instructions.
After multiple failed attempts, the best performance I've able to reach is 4-6x slower than Skia,
which is simply unacceptable. If someone is interested in porting it, let me know.
It's "only" 3 KLOC.

You can find more information in [benches/README.md](./benches/README.md).

## API overview

The API is a bit unconventional. It doesn't look like cairo, QPainter (Qt) or even Skia.

To start, it's completely stateless. There is no canvas-like object that stores a transform,
clip, layers, etc. You only have a `Pixmap` and you can draw a `Path` on top of it. That's it.<br>
If you want to draw a transformed `Path` you should transform it first, and then you can fill it.<br>
If you want to stroke a `Path` you should create a stroked `Path` from an existing `Path`,
and then you can fill it.<br>
The main motivation behind this is that there is almost no hidden cost (like allocations).
Everything is transparent to the caller.

Another difference is that everting is strongly typed and checked on creation.
There are almost no methods that accept primive types (`i32`, `f32`, etc.).
`Size`, `Rect`, `Color`, `Path` - everything is guarantee to be valid at all times.
You cannot create a zero or negative `Size`. You cannot create an empty `Path`.
You cannot create a transform with a zero scale. And so on.<br>
Most of it is handled by externals crates like
[checked-geom](https://github.com/RazrFalcon/checked-geom)
and [num-ext](https://github.com/RazrFalcon/num-ext).

## Roadmap

### v0.2

- [x] Foundation: `Pixmap`, `Painter`, `Path`, geometry primitives, etc.
- [x] Adapt a minimal `SkRasterPipeline` fork
- [x] PNG load/save
- [x] Blending modes
- [x] `Path` filling
- [x] Anti-aliased `Path` filling
- [ ] Analytical anti-aliased `Path` filling
- [ ] `Path` stroking
- [ ] `Path` hairline stroking
- [ ] Anti-aliased `Path` hairline stroking
- [ ] Stroke dashing
- [ ] Gradients (linear and two point conical)
- [ ] `Pixmap`s blending (image on image rendering)
- [ ] Patterns

### v0.3

- [ ] Clipping
- [ ] Anti-aliased clipping

### v0.N

- Move `Path` and most of BÃ©zier math into separate crates. Preferably into existing one

PS: we start from 0.2, because 0.1 was just a bindings.

## Notes about the port

`tiny-skia` should be viewed as a Rust 2D rendering library that uses Skia algorithms internally.
We have a completely different public API. The internals are also extremely simplified.
But all the core logic and math is borrowed from Skia. Hence the name.

As for the porting process itself, Skia uses goto, inheritance, virtual methods, linked lists,
const generics and templates specialization a lot, and all of this features are unavailable in Rust.
There are also a lot of pointers magic, implicit mutations and caches.
Therefore we have to compromise or even rewrite some parts from scratch.

## Safety

The project relies heavily on unsafe. Not much we can do about it at the moment.
